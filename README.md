# Daily Codex

Welcome to Daily Codex, a project that reflects my working and studying daily essential tools. This project is a rolling release, evolving with my personal needs and activities.

## Overview

Daily Codex is designed to enhance your daily coding practice by providing a dynamic platform for regular code challenges and essential tools. It adapts over time, mirroring changes in my job, hobbies, and activities.

### Key Points

- **Dynamic Content:** The packages and tools included in Daily Codex change as my needs evolve. What you see today might differ from what’s available tomorrow.
- **Personal Milestones:** At every significant life milestone, I create a tag to freeze that version for eternity. For example, if I transition from Ruby to Rust, I will create a final stable version tagged as "Ruby-farewell-version".
- **Use at Your Own Risk:** While you are welcome to use Daily Codex as a base, please note that it’s tailored to my personal requirements. I do not recommend relying on it 100% as it may not fit your specific needs.
